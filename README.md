Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
📌 Overview

A fully responsive Amazon homepage clone built using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, created to strengthen my core frontend development skills and understand real-world e-commerce UI layouts.

This project replicates the major sections of Amazon’s homepage, including the navbar, product cards, hero section, shopping categories, and footer.

📌 Key Features

✔ Responsive Navbar – Amazon-style navigation bar with logo, address selector, search bar, language option, account section, and cart icon.
✔ Hero Banner – Styled slider-like banner using CSS and JS.
✔ Product Category Cards – Grid layout showcasing different products with hover effects.
✔ Deals & Offers Section – Created using reusable card components.
✔ Footer UI – Multi-column Amazon-style footer with links and info.
